### Publications
This directory contains papers related to bioinformatics that provide background and context for the methods and tools used in this repository.

### phylogenetic.tree.overview.md
This file offers a basic overview of key concepts in phylogenetic tree construction, including *sequence alignment*, *substitution models*, *tree-building methods*, and *bootstrap resampling*. It covers essential topics of phylogenetic analysis, explaining how genetic data is aligned, the models used to predict sequence evolution, and how trees are built and interpreted to visualize evolutionary relationships.

### Sanger-sequence.pipeline.pdf
This figure provides an overview of a bioinformatic pipeline used to process raw Sanger sequencing data, including files such as *phd*, *.ab1*, and *seq*. It covers fundamental steps from quality control and sequence assembly to alignment, BLAST searching, and phylogenetic tree construction for visualization and analysis.
