# Supplement

## Publications
This directory contains papers related to bioinformatics that provide background and context for the methods and tools used in this repository.

## phylogenetic-tree.overview.md
This file offers a basic overview of key concepts in phylogenetic tree construction, including:
- *Sequence alignment*
- *Substitution models*
- *Tree-building methods*
- *Bootstrap resampling*

It covers essential topics of phylogenetic analysis, explaining how genetic data is aligned, the models used to predict sequence evolution, and how trees are built and interpreted to visualize evolutionary relationships.

## sanger-sequencing.pipeline.pdf
This figure provides an overview of a bioinformatics pipeline used to process raw Sanger sequencing data, including files such as *phd*, *.ab1*, and *seq*. 

It covers fundamental steps including:
- Quality control
- Sequence assembly
- Alignment
- BLAST searching
- Phylogenetic tree construction for visualization and analysis.
