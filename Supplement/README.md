# Supplement

### Publications
This directory contains papers related to bioinformatics that provide background and context for the methods and tools used in this repository.

### phylogenetic.tree.overview.md
This file offers a basic overview of key concepts in phylogenetic tree construction, including *sequence alignment*, *substitution models*, *tree-building methods*, and *bootstrap resampling*. It covers the essential topics of phylogenetic analysis, explaining how genetic data is aligned, the models used to predict sequence evolution, and how trees are built and interpreted to visualize evolutionary relationships.

### Sanger-sequence.pipeline.pdf
This figure provides an overview of a bioinformatic pipeline used to process raw Sanger sequencing data, including files such as *phd*, *.ab1*, and *seq*. It covers key steps from quality control and sequence assembly to alignment, BLAST searching, and phylogenetic tree construction for visualization and analysis.
